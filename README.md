Saw a youtube tutorial https://youtu.be/7CqJlxBYj-M where the idea was born. I decided to rewrite the enitre code base,
using react hooks as opposed to class components styled react. 
# Feel free to use the code
If you're trying to understand react hooks, feel free to clone and use the code base anyway you see fit.
