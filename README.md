# Fullstack-Exercise-Tracker
Saw a youtube tutorial https://youtu.be/7CqJlxBYj-M. I decided to rewrite the enitre code base,
using only react hooks as opposed to class components styled react. 

# Feel free to use the code
If you're trying to understand react hooks, feel free to clone and use the code base anyway you see fit. 

# Getting Started with Create React App
An exercise tracker app created with bootstrapped with Create React App

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start for Client/FrontEnd Side`
Runs the app in the development mode.
make sure to change into the client folder by typing "cd Client" then type "npm start" to run client server and serve front end files in your browser
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm start for Server/BackEnd Side`
make sure to type "cd backend" to access the back end terminal then type "node server.js" to start the server.
replace the uri variable with your database uri and you are good to go.
Cors has been added in the server.js file to enable resource sharing across servers  
Server[[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)] to view server in browser
